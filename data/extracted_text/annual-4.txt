Independent auditor’s report
(English translation of a report originally issued in Korean)
The Shareholders and Board of Directors
Hyundai Motor Company
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Hyundai Motor Company and its subsidiaries
(collectively referred to as the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as of
December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of
comprehensive income, consolidated statements of changes in equity and consolidated statements of cash
flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the notes to the consolidated
financial statements, including material accounting policy information.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Group as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and its consolidated financial
performance and its consolidated cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024,
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the Republic of Korea (“KIFRS”).
We have audited the Group’s internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”) for consolidation purposes as of
December 31, 2024 based on the Conceptual Framework for Design and Operation of ICFR established by
the Operating Committee of ICFR in Korea, in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing (“KSA”), and our
report dated March 5, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with KSA. Our responsibilities under those standards are further
described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our
report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our
audit of the consolidated financial statements in the Republic of Korea, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit
of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of
our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do
not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit
addressed the matter is provided in that context.
1) Valuation of sales warranty provisions
As described in Note 2.(20) to the consolidated financial statements, the Group provides free warranty services
to customers during the guaranteed period after the sale of a vehicle and also in the event of a recall or
campaign due to quality issues. As of December 31, 2024, the Group has recognized a total of ￦9,567,739
million in sales warranty provisions, including provisions for the obligation to provide free warranty services
(Note 16).
When estimating the balance of provisions for the obligation to provide free repairs, the Group uses historical
data such as sales volume by vehicle type and past repair expenses that occurred from warranty services, and
assumptions such as expected increase rate of unit repair price and expected free repair occurrence rate. The
underlying data collected and aggregated in the process is vast and complex, and the management
assumptions applied are highly subjective and uncertain and it is highly probable that any errors therein may
cause material misstatement in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we selected the
valuation of the sales warranty provisions as a key audit matter.
The primary audit procedures we performed to address this key audit matter include the following:
- Evaluating whether control activities to measure and recognize the sales warranty provisions are properly
designed and operated;
- Evaluating whether general control and automatic control of the IT system that aggregates historical sales
warranty data are properly designed and operated by engaging IT specialists;
- Reviewing the underlying data of management’s accounting estimates by comparing with other internal and
external information;
- Analyzing the basis of management’s key assumptions used for the measurement of related liabilities by
comparing with historical data;
- Conducting independent recalculation of the balance of related liabilities as of December 31, 2024;
- Evaluating the estimates by vehicle type for the previous year by comparing with the actual results in the
current year; and
- Evaluating the appropriateness of other significant considerations that have affected the balance of the
provisions.
2) Valuation of financial services receivables
According to the accounting policies for the valuation of financial services receivables described in Note 2.(8)
to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2024, the Group recognized financial services
receivables, net, and loss allowance of ￦130,761,501 million and ￦ 2,087,126 million, respectively (Note 14).
In accordance with KIFRS 1109 Financial Instruments, the Group recognizes allowance for credit loss for
financial services receivables using the expected credit loss (ECL) model. The ECL model requires
management judgment to assess whether the receivable has undergone a significant increase in credit risk,
as well as other assumptions, such as credit rating and macroeconomic variables. In addition, the Group also
considers historical transaction data, such as delinquency days, bankruptcy, and collection, to determine
assumptions used in the ECL model. As errors in the assumptions applied to the ECL model could have a
significant impact on the consolidated financial statements, we identified the valuation of financial services
receivables as a key audit matter.
The primary audit procedures we performed to address this key audit matter include the following:
- Assessing whether the Group’s accounting policies comply with the requirements under KIFRS 1109
Financial Instruments;
- Reviewing the process of measurement of credit loss allowance for financial services receivables and
testing relevant controls;
- Assessing the credit rating and classification of credit quality, including the identification of significant
increase in credit risk, through inspection of related documents on a sample basis; and
- Reviewing the underlying data for probability of default and loss given default and testing the
appropriateness of calculation methods used for the estimation through recalculation.
Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial st
atements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements
in accordance with KIFRS, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations,
or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with KSA will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated
financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with KSA, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances.
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by management.
 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including
the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions
and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business
activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible
for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we
identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that
may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were
of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore
the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should
not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Do Hun, Han.

2. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
(1) Basis of consolidated financial statements preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
as adopted by the Republic of Korea (“KIFRS”), as prescribed in the Act on External Audit of Stock Companies, Etc in
the Republic of Korea.
The material accounting policies used for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are summarized below.
These material accounting policies are consistent with those applied to the consolidated financial statements as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2023, except for the new or amended accounting standards and interpretations described
below.
1) New and amended standards that have been applied from the year beginning on January 1, 2024 are as follows.
The Group applied Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (KIFRS 1116 Lease), Classification of Liabilities as Current
or Non-current (KIFRS 1001 Presentation of Financial Statements), Supplier Finance Arrangements (KIFRS 1007
Statement of Cash Flows, KIFRS 1107 Financial Instruments: Disclosure) and Virtual Asset Disclosure (KIFRS 1001
Presentation of Financial Statements) for the first time on January 1, 2024. These standards and other new accounting
standards effective from January 1, 2024 do not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
2) The new and amended standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, for the annual reporting
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 are disclosed below. The Group has not early adopted these standards and
interpretations.
- Lack of Exchangeability (KIFRS 1021 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates)
The Group is currently evaluating the effect of the new or amended standards and interpretations listed above, if any, to
the consolidated financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on January 23, 2025 and are expected to
be submitted for the Company's annual general meeting of shareholders.
(2) Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except as otherwise stated in the
accounting policies below. Historical cost is usually measured at the fair value of the consideration given to acquire the
assets.
23
(3) Basis of consolidations
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities (including
structured entities) controlled by the Company (or its subsidiaries). Control is achieved when the Company:
 has power over the investee;
 is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
 has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to
one or more of the three elements of control listed above.
Even if the Group has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the investee when the
voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The
Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the Group’s voting rights in an investee
are sufficient to give it power, including:
 the size of the Group’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote
holders;
 potential voting rights held by the Group, other vote holders or other parties;
 rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and
 any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Group has, or does not have, the current ability to
direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous
shareholders’ meetings.
Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated statements
of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into
line with those used by the Group. All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on
consolidation. Non-controlling interests are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity,
separately from the equity of the owners of the Group. The carrying amount of non-controlling interests consists of the
amount of those non-controlling interests at the initial recognition and the changes in shares of the non-controlling
interests in equity since the date of the acquisition. Total comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the Group
and to the non-controlling interests even if the non-controlling interest has a deficit balance.
Changes in the Group's ownership interests in subsidiaries, without a loss of control, are accounted for as equity
transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group's interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the
changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling
interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity and attributed
to owners of the Group.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the
aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous
carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests.
The amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are accounted for as if the
Group had directly disposed of the relevant assets (i.e., reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained
earnings as specified by applicable KIFRS). The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date
when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under KIFRS 1109
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment
in an associate or a joint venture.
(4) Business combination
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business
combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets
transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. The consideration includes any asset or liability resulting
from a contingent consideration arrangement and is measured at fair value.
24
Acquisition-related costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. When a business combination is achieved in stages,
the Group's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured at its fair value at the acquisition date (i.e., the
date when the Group obtains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in profit or loss. Prior to the
acquisition date, the amount resulting from changes in the value of its equity interest in the acquiree that have previously
been recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where such treatment would be
appropriate if that interest were directly disposed of.
(5) Revenue recognition
In accordance with KIFRS 1115, all types of contracts recognize revenues by the 5-step revenue recognition model (1)
identification of contract → (2) identification of performance obligations → (3) calculation of transaction price → (4)
allocation of transaction price to performance obligations → (5) recognition of revenue when performance obligation is
satisfied.
1) Identification of performance obligations
The Group operates businesses such as the manufacture and sale of automobiles and auto parts. In the automobile sales
contracts with customers, services other than automobile sales are separately identified as performance obligations.
2) Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time
Revenue is recognized when the performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the Group’s customer are
satisfied, which generally occurs with the transfer of control of goods or services.
3) Performance obligations satisfied over time
In assessing whether the control over goods or services is transferred over time, the Group evaluates whether the customer
simultaneously obtains and consumes the benefits provided by the Group’s performance, whether the assets are controlled
by the customer, and whether the assets created by the Group have no substitute purpose, and whether the Group is entitled
to reimbursement of costs incurred to date, including a reasonable margin.
4) Allocation of transaction price
The Group allocates the transaction price to each of the performance obligations identified in a single contract in
proportion to its stand-alone selling price. When the stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, the Group
estimates the stand-alone selling price using the adjusted market assessment approach, or the expected cost plus a margin
approach.
5) Variable consideration
The Group estimates the amount of consideration it will be entitled to receive using the method (either the expected value
method or the most likely amount method) that provides the most accurate prediction.
Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant
reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized will not occur in future periods.
6) Significant financing element
If the period between the transfer of the goods or services promised to the customer and the payment from the customer
is within one year, the Group does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing
component, as a practical expedient.
25
7) Construction contracts
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, the contract revenue and contract costs associated
with the construction contract are recognized as revenue and expenses, respectively, by reference to the stage of
completion of the contract activity at the end of reporting period.
The percentage of completion of a contract activity is reliably measured based on the proportion of contract costs incurred
for work performed to date relative to the estimated total contract costs, by surveys of work performed or by completion
of a physical proportion of the contract work. Variations in contract work, claim and incentive payments are included to
the extent that the amount can be measured reliably and its receipt is considered probable. Where the outcome of a
construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognized to the extent of contract costs incurred
that it is probable will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognized as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognized as an
expense immediately.
(6) Foreign currency translation
The individual financial statements of each entity in the Group are prepared and presented in the currency of the
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency).
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions occurring in currencies other than their
functional currency (foreign currencies) are recorded using the exchange rate on the dates of the transactions. At the end
of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate at the
end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are
translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange
differences resulting from settlement of assets or liabilities and translation of monetary items denominated in foreign
currencies are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for some exceptions.
Foreign exchange gains or losses are classified as finance income (expenses) or other income (expenses) by the nature of
the transaction or event.
For the purpose of presenting the consolidated financial statements, assets and liabilities in the Group’s foreign operations
are translated into Won, using the exchange rates at the end of reporting period. Income and expense items are translated
at the average exchange rate for the period, unless the exchange rate during the period has significantly fluctuated, in
which case the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used. The exchange differences arising, if any, are
recognized in equity as other comprehensive income. Upon the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount
of the exchange differences relating to that foreign operation is reclassified from equity to profit or loss when the gain or
loss on disposal is recognized. Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value
adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition of that foreign operation are treated
as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the exchange rate at the end of reporting period.
(7) Financial Assets
The Group classifies financial assets as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets
measured at amortized cost or financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income according to
the terms and purpose of acquisition. The Group determines the classification of a financial asset at initial recognition.
All recognized financial assets are measured subsequently in their entirety at either amortized cost or fair value, depending
on the classification of the financial assets.
1) Classification of financial assets
Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are measured subsequently at amortized cost:
 The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to
collect contractual cash flows; and
 The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments
of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
26
Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are measured subsequently at fair value through other comprehensive
income (FVOCI):
 the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual
cash flows and selling the financial assets; and
 the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
By default, all other financial assets are measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL).
Despite the foregoing, the Group may make the following irrevocable election / designation at initial recognition of a
financial asset:
 the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value of an equity investment in other
comprehensive income if certain criteria are met; and
 the Group may irrevocably designate a debt investment that meets the amortized cost or FVOCI criteria as
measured at FVPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch.
1-1) Amortization cost and effective interest rate method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest
income over the relevant period. The amortized cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is
measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortisation using the effective
interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance.
The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortized cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any loss
allowance. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method for debt instruments measured subsequently
at amortized cost and at FVOCI.
1-2) Debt instruments classified as at FVOCI
Corporate bonds are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, changes in the carrying amount
of these corporate bonds as a result of foreign exchange gains and losses, impairment gains or losses, and interest income
calculated using the effective interest method are recognized in profit or loss. The amounts that are recognized in profit
or loss are the same as the amounts that would have been recognized in profit or loss if these corporate bonds had been
measured at amortized cost. All other changes in the carrying amount of these corporate bonds are recognized in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in investments revaluation reserve. When these corporate bonds are
derecognized, the cumulative gains or losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to
profit or loss.
1-3) Equity instruments designated as at FVOCI
On initial recognition, the Group may make an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate
investments in equity instruments as at FVOCI. Designation at FVOCI is not permitted if the equity investment is held
for trading or if it is contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination.
Investments in equity instruments at FVOCI are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, they
are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive
income and accumulated in the investments revaluation reserve. The cumulative gain or loss will not be reclassified to
profit or loss on disposal of the equity investments, instead, it is transferred to retained earnings.
1-4) Financial assets measured at FVPL
Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. Gains
or losses arising from changes in the fair value of FVPL, dividends and interest income from the financial assets are
recognized in profit or loss.
2) Foreign exchange gain / loss
The carrying amount of a financial asset designated as a foreign currency is determined in foreign currencies and is
translated at the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.
27
(8) Impairment of financial assets
The Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses on investments in debt instruments that are measured
at amortized cost or at FVOCI, lease receivables, trade receivables and contract assets, as well as on financial guarantee
contracts. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since
initial recognition of the respective financial instrument.
The Group always recognizes lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) for trade receivables, contract assets and lease
receivables. The ECLs on these financial assets are estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group’s historical
credit loss experience and valuation of individual assets, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general
economic conditions and an assessment of forecast on present and future conditions reflecting time value of money where
appropriate.
For all other financial instruments, the Group recognizes lifetime ECLs when there has been a significant increase in
credit risk since initial recognition. However, if the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly
since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-
month ECLs.
Lifetime ECL represents the expected credit losses that will result from all possible default events over the expected life
of a financial instrument. In contrast, 12-month ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from
default events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date.
1) Significant increase in credit risk
In assessing whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the
Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the reporting date with the risk of a default
occurring on the financial instrument at the date of initial recognition.
In particular, the following information is taken into account when assessing whether credit risk has increased
significantly since initial recognition:
 an actual or expected significant deterioration in the financial instrument’s external (if available) or internal
credit rating; and
 other significant increases in credit risk.
2) Definition of default
The Group believes that, based on past experience, if the debtor violates the terms of the contract, it is considered to
constitute a default event for internal credit risk management purposes.
3) Credit-impaired financial assets
A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash
flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following
observable data:
(a) significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower;
(b) a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event as defined by the Group’s internal policy.
4) Measurements and recognition of expected credit losses
The measurement of ECLs is a function of the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss if
there is a default) and the exposure at default. The assessment of the probability of default and loss given default is based
on historical data adjusted by forward-looking information as described above. As for the exposure at default, for financial
assets, this is represented by the assets’ gross carrying amount at the reporting date.
For financial assets, the ECLs are estimated as the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Group
in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the original effective
interest rate.

If the Group has measured the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs in the
previous reporting period, but determines at the current reporting date that the conditions for lifetime ECLs are no longer
met, the Group measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs at the current reporting date, except
for financial assets for which a simplified approach is used.
The Group recognizes an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss for all financial instruments with a corresponding
adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account, except for investments in debt instruments that are
measured at FVOCI, for which the loss allowance is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the
investment revaluation reserve, and does not reduce the carrying amount of the financial asset in the statement of financial
position.
(9) Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when
it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the
Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the
transferred asset, the Group recognizes its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have
to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group
continues to recognize the financial asset and also recognizes a collateralized borrowing for the proceeds received.
On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortized cost, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and
the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss. In addition, on derecognition of an
investment in a debt instrument classified as at FVOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the
investments revaluation reserve is reclassified to profit or loss. In contrast, on derecognition of an investment in equity
instrument which the Group has elected on initial recognition to measure at FVOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously
accumulated in the investments revaluation reserve is not reclassified to profit or loss, but is transferred to retained
earnings.
(10) Inventory
Inventory is measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventory cost, including the fixed and variable
manufacturing overhead cost, is calculated, using the moving average method, except for the cost for inventory in transit,
which is determined by the specific identification method.
(11) Investments in associates and joint ventures
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence, but not a joint venture or a subsidiary. Significant
influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or
joint control over those policies.
A joint venture is a joint arrangement, whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the
net assets of the joint arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which
exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognized at cost and accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method, an investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognized in the consolidated
statement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Group's share of the profit or loss and other
comprehensive income of the associate or the joint venture.
When the Group's share of losses of an associate or a joint venture exceeds the Group's interest in that associate or joint
venture (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group's net investment in the associate
or the joint venture), the Group discontinues recognizing its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognized only
to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or
the joint venture.
Investment in associate or joint venture is accounted for using the equity method from the date that the investee becomes
the associate or joint venture. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's share of the net fair value of the
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of an associate or a joint venture recognized at the date of
acquisition is recognized as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment.
29
Any excess of the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over
the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss.
The requirements of KIFRS 1028 are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognize any impairment loss with
respect to the Group’s investment in an associate or a joint venture. When there is any indication of impairment, the entire
carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with KIFRS 1036 as a
single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal) with its
carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill that forms part of the
carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized in accordance with KIFRS 1036
to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.
Upon disposal of an associate or a joint venture that results in the Group losing significant influence over that associate
or joint venture, any retained investment is measured at fair value at that date and the fair value is regarded as its fair
value on initial recognition as a financial asset in accordance with KIFRS 1109. The difference between the previous
carrying amount of the associate or joint venture attributable to the retained interest and its fair value is included in the
determination of the gain or loss on disposal of the associate or joint venture. In addition, the Group accounts for all
amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate or joint venture on the same
basis it would be required if that associate or joint venture had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
Therefore, if a gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income by that associate or joint venture would
be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities, the Group reclassifies the gain or loss
from equity to profit or loss (as reclassification adjustment) when it loses significant influence over that associate or joint
venture. When the Group reduces its ownership interest in an associate or a joint venture, but the Group continues to use
the equity method, the Group reclassifies to profit or loss the proportion of the gain or loss that had previously been
recognized in other comprehensive income relating to that reduction in ownership interest if that gain or loss would be
reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities. In addition, the Group applies KIFRS 1105
to a portion of investment in an associate or a joint venture that meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
The Group continues to use the equity method when an investment in an associate becomes an investment in a joint
venture or an investment in a joint venture becomes an investment in an associate. There is no remeasurement to fair
value upon such changes in ownership interests.
Unrealized gains from transactions between the Group and its associates or joint ventures are eliminated up to the shares
in associate (joint venture) stocks. Unrealized losses are also eliminated, unless evidence of impairment in assets
transferred is produced. If the accounting policy of associates or joint ventures differs from the Group, financial
statements are adjusted accordingly before applying equity method of accounting.
(12) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recognized if, and only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the
asset will flow to the Group, and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. After the initial recognition, property,
plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost includes
any cost directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating
in the manner intended by management and the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and
restoring the site on which it is located. In addition, in case the recognition criteria are met, the subsequent costs will be
added to the carrying amount of the asset or recognized as a separate asset, and the carrying amount of what was replaced
is derecognized.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The
representative useful lives are as follows.
Representative useful lives (years)
Buildings and structures 12 – 50
Machinery and equipment 6 – 15
Vehicles 6 – 15
Dies, mold and tools 4 – 6
Office equipment 3 – 15
Other 2 – 20
30
The Group reviews the depreciation method, the estimated useful lives and residual values of property, plant and
equipment at the end of each annual reporting period. If expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes are
accounted for as a change in accounting estimate.
(13) Investment properties
Investment properties are property held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both. Investment properties are
measured initially at its cost and transaction costs are included in the initial measurement. After initial recognition, the
book value of investment properties is presented at the cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses.
Subsequent costs are recognized as the carrying amount of the asset when, and only when it is probable that future
economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the Group, and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably, or
recognized as a separate asset if appropriate. The carrying amount of what was replaced is derecognized.
Land is not depreciated, and other investment properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over the period
from 20 to 50 years. The Group reviews the depreciation method, the estimated useful lives and residual values at the
end of each annual reporting period. If expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a
change in accounting estimate.
(14) Intangible assets
1) Goodwill
Goodwill arising from a business combination is recognized as an asset at the time of obtaining control (the acquisition
date). Goodwill is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-
controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of the Group’s previously held equity interest in the
acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If, after reassessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed
exceeds the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, and the
acquisition-date fair value of the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree, the excess is recognized
immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually. For purposes of impairment tests, goodwill is
allocated to those cash-generating units (“CGU”) of the Group expected to have synergies from the business combination.
CGU that goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment every year or when an event occurs that indicates
impairment.
If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment will first decrease the goodwill
allocated to that CGU and the remaining impairment will be allocated among other assets relative to its carrying value.
Impairment recognized for goodwill may not be reversed. When disposing a subsidiary, related goodwill will be included
in gain or loss from disposal.
2) Development costs
The expenditure on research is recognized as an expense when it is incurred. The expenditure on development is
recognized as an intangible asset, and amortization is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated
useful lives of the assets since the asset is available for use or sale.
Research and development activities are conducted in phases of preceding research, development approval, product
development and mass production. The Group generally recognizes intangible assets as development activities after the
development approval phases which product specification, release schedule, and sales plan are established. Expenditure
incurred at the previous phase is recognized as an expense as it is considered as research activities when it is incurred.
3) Intangible assets acquired separately
Intangible assets are measured initially at cost, and are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortization and
accumulated impairment losses.
31
Intangible assets are amortized by the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives from the date of availability.
The Group reviews the estimated useful life and amortization method at the end of each annual reporting period. If
expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in accounting estimate. Intangible
assets assessed as having indefinite useful life such as club membership are subjected to impairment test at least once a
year without amortization.
The representative useful lives are as follows.
Representative useful lives (years)
Development costs (*)
Industrial property rights 5 – 10
Software 3 – 7
Other 3 – 40
(*) Development costs recognized as assets are amortized over useful lives which reflects the developed assets’ life
cycles.
The Group reviews the estimated useful life and amortization method at the end of each annual reporting period and
changed the estimated useful life of some types of development costs during the year ended December 31, 2024. As a
result of this change in accounting estimate, net profit has increased by \419,817 million.
(15) Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If
any such indication exists, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset to determine the extent of the
impairment loss. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. If the cash inflows of
an individual asset are largely independent from other assets or group of assets, the recoverable amount is measured for
that individual asset; otherwise, it is measured for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. An
impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, impairment loss is reversed if the recoverable
amount increases in subsequent years, but only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives or intangible assets not yet available for use are not amortized, but tested for
impairment annually.
(16) Non-current assets classified as held for sale
The Group classifies a non-current asset (or disposal group) as held for sale, if its carrying amount will be recovered
principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. For this to be the case, the asset (or disposal
group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary
for sales of such assets (or disposal groups) and its sale must be highly probable. The management must be committed
to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group), and the sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed
sale within one year from the date of classification.
Non-current assets (or disposal group) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and
fair value, less costs to sell.
(17) Lease
At contract inception, the Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if
the contract conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
When assessing whether the contract conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset, definition of a lease under
KIFRS 1116 has been applied.
1) As a lessee
At inception or effective date of change, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease on the basis
of their relative stand-alone prices. However, for leases of properties in which it is a lessee, the Group has elected not to
separate non-lease components and will instead account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease
component.
32
The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is
initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made
at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove
the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentive received.
The right-of use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end
of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or
the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset
will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property
and equipment. In addition, the right-of use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for
certain remeasurements of the lease liability.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement
date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s
incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.
When the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use
asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
The Group has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-
term leases. The Group recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis
over the lease term.
2) As a lessor
The accounting policies applicable in the same period to the Group as a lessor are not different from those under KIFRS
1116. When the Group acted as a lessor, it determined at lease inception whether each lease was a finance lease or an
operating lease. To classify each lease, the Group made an overall assessment of whether the lease transferred
substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this was the case, then the
lease was a finance lease; if not, then it was an operating lease.
Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recognized as receivables at the amount of the Group’s net investment
in the leases. Finance lease interest income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect an effective interest rate on
the Group’s net investment outstanding in respect of the leases. Rental income from operating leases is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating
lease are added to the carrying amount of the carrying amount of investments in operating leases and recognized as
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(18) Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets are capitalized to
the cost of those assets, until they are ready for their intended use or sale. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. Investment income earned on the temporary
investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs
eligible for capitalization. All other borrowing costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are
incurred.
(19) Defined benefit plans
The retirement benefit obligation recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position represents the present
value of the defined benefit obligation, less the fair value of plan assets. Defined benefit obligations are calculated
annually by an actuary using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
33
The present value of the defined benefit obligations is measured by discounting estimated future cash outflows by the
interest rate of high-quality corporate bonds, with similar maturity as the expected retirement benefit payment date. In
countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market yields at the end of the reporting period on government
bonds are used.
The remeasurements of the net defined benefit liabilities (assets) comprising actuarial gain or loss from changes in
actuarial assumptions or differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results, the effect of the changes to the
asset ceiling and return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liabilities
(assets), are recognized in other comprehensive income of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, which
is immediately recognized as retained earnings. Those recognized in retained earnings will not be reclassified in profit
or loss. Past service costs are recognized in profit and loss when the plan amendment occurs, and net interest is calculated
by applying the discount rate determined at the beginning of the annual reporting period to the net defined benefit
liabilities (assets). Defined benefit costs are composed of service cost (including current service cost, past service cost,
as well as gains and losses on settlements), net interest expense (income), and remeasurements.
The retirement benefit obligation recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position represents the actual
deficit or surplus in the Group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present
value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the
plans.
Contributions to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognized as expenses when employees provide
services eligible for payment.
(20) Provisions
A provision is recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the
consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and
uncertainties surrounding the obligation. A provision is measured using the present value of the cash flows estimated to
settle the present obligation. The increase in provision due to passage of time is recognized as interest expense.
The Group recognizes provisions for costs expected to be incurred in the future for the repair of regular parts within the
warranty period based on historical experience and compensation for accidents caused by defects in the exported products
or parts of the product when such amounts are probable of payment. Also, the Group recognizes provisions for the
probable losses of unused loan commitment, construction contracts, pre-contract sale or service contract due to legal or
constructive obligations. In addition, provisions are recognized for estimated payments of long-term employee benefits
that will be paid to employees in return for their long-term service.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party,
a receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the
receivable can be measured reliably.
(21) Taxation
Income tax expense is composed of current and deferred tax.
1) Current tax
The current tax is computed based on the taxable profit for the current year. The taxable profit differs from the profit
before income tax as reported in the consolidated statements of income because it excludes items of income or expense
that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s
current tax liability is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting
period. The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or
received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any.
34
2) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax
liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets shall be generally recognized
for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which
those deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities shall not be recognized if
the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of
other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and
associates and interests in joint ventures, except when the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the
temporary difference, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred
tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only
recognized to the extent that taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilized and
they are expected to be reversed in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied in the period in which the
liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted
by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities reflects the tax consequences
that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and
liabilities at the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income tax levied by the same taxation authority. Also, they are offset when
different taxable entities that intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realize the assets
and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or
assets are expected to be settled or recovered.
3) Recognition of current and deferred taxes
Current and deferred taxes are recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognized in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity, or items arising from initial accounting treatments of a business combination.
The tax effect arising from a business combination is included in the accounting for the business combination.
In addition, Pillar Two laws have been enacted or substantially enacted in some jurisdictions where the Group operates,
and Pillar Two laws have come into effect during the Group’s reporting period beginning on January 1, 2024.
(22) Treasury stock
When the Group repurchases its equity instruments (treasury stock), the incremental costs and net of tax effect are
deducted from equity and recognized as other capital item deducted from the total equity in the consolidated statements
of financial position. In addition, profits or losses from purchase, sale or retirement of treasury stocks are directly
recognized in equity and not in current profit or loss.
(23) Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Debt instruments and equity instruments issued by the Group are recognized as financial liabilities or equity depending
on the contract and the definitions of financial liability and equity instrument.
1) Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Repurchase of the Company’s own equity instruments is recognized and deducted directly in equity. No gain or loss is
recognized in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments.
35
2) Financial guarantee liability
A financial guarantee contract is a contract that the issuer must pay a certain amount of money to compensate for losses
incurred by the holder due to the failure of a specific debtor to pay the due date on the original contract or modified terms
of the debt instrument. Financial guarantee liabilities are measured initially at fair value and subsequently measured at
the greater of the following, unless they are designated as at fair value through profit or loss or arising from the transfer
of assets.
 Loss provision calculated in accordance with KIFRS 1109
 The amount recognized less the accumulated profits recognized in accordance with KIFRS 1115
3) Financial liabilities measured at FVPL
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVPL when the financial liability is (i) contingent consideration of an acquirer in
a business combination, (ii) held for trading or (iii) it is designated as at FVPL as of the date of initial recognition.
However, for financial liabilities that are designated as at FVPL, the amount of change in the fair value of the financial
liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability is recognized in other comprehensive income,
unless the recognition of the effects of changes in the liability’s credit risk in other comprehensive income would create
or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. The remaining amount of change in the fair value of liability is
recognized in profit or loss. Changes in fair value attributable to a financial liability’s credit risk that are recognized in
other comprehensive income are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss; instead, they are transferred to retained
earnings upon derecognition of the financial liability. Gains or losses on financial guarantee contracts issued by the Group
that are designated by the Group as at FVPL are recognized in profit or loss.
4) Financial liabilities measured subsequently at amortized cost
Financial liabilities that are not (i) contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business combination, (ii) held for trading,
or (iii) designated as at FVPL as of the date of initial recognition, are measured subsequently at amortized cost using the
effective interest method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial liability
and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
5) Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or
have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration
paid and payable is recognized in profit or loss.
(24) Derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently
remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss
immediately, unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in such case, the timing of the
recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the risk of changes in fair value of a recognized
asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedges) and the risk of changes in cash flow of a highly
probable forecast transaction and the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of firm commitment (cash flow
hedges).
1) Fair value hedges
The Group recognizes the changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualified as fair value hedges
are recognized in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability
that are attributable to the hedged risk. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship,
when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or when it is no longer qualified for hedge
accounting. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortized
to profit or loss from that date.
36
2) Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualified as cash flow hedges is
recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately
in profit or loss. Amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are
reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. If the forecast transaction results
in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the related gain and loss recognized in other comprehensive income
and accumulated in equity are transferred from equity to the initial cost of related non-financial asset or liability.
Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, when the hedging
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or it no longer qualifies for the criteria of hedging. Any gain or
loss accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity, and is recognized as profit or loss when the forecast transaction
occurs. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognized
immediately in profit or loss.
(25) Fair value
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using
another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the
characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing
the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated
financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for leasing transactions that are within the scope of KIFRS
1116 Leases, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value, but are not fair value, such as net realisable
value in KIFRS 1002 Inventories or value in use in KIFRS 1036 Impairment of Assets.
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorized into Levels 1, 2 or 3, based on the
degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair
value measurement in its entirety, which are described in Note 19.
(26) Accounting Treatment related to the Emission Rights Cap and Trade Scheme
The Group classifies the emission rights as intangible assets. The emission rights allowances received from the
government free of charge are measured at zero, while purchased emission rights allowances are measured at cost. No
emission liability is recognized if the expected quantity of emission for the performing period does not exceed the
emission allowance in possession. If the expected emissions exceed the emission allowances held, the emission liability
is measured and recognized based on the expected excess quantity of emissions and the market unit price of the emission
rights at the end of the reporting period.
(27) Significant accounting estimates and key sources of estimation uncertainties
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, management is required to make judgments, estimates and
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that cannot be identified from other sources. The
estimation and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual
results may be different from those estimations. The estimates and underlying assumptions are continually evaluated.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only
that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties at December 31, 2024 that have a significant risk of resulting
in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year is as follows.
1) Impairment test for goodwill and non-financial assets
Determining whether goodwill and non-financial asset is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGU
to which goodwill has been allocated and value in use of non-financial assets. The value in use calculation requires the
management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to
calculate present value.
37
2) Warranty provision
The Group recognizes provisions for the warranties of its products as described in Note 2.(20). The amounts are
recognized based on the best estimate of amounts necessary to settle the present and future warranty obligation.
3) Defined benefit plans
The Group operates defined retirement benefit plans. Defined benefit obligations are determined at the end of each
reporting period using an actuarial valuation method that requires management assumptions on discount rates, rates of
expected future salary increases and mortality rates. The characteristic of post-employment benefit plan that serves for
the long term period causes significant uncertainties when the post-employment benefit obligation is estimated.
4) Taxation
The Group recognizes current tax and deferred tax based on the best estimates of income tax effect to be charged in the
future as the result of operating activities until the end of the reporting period. However, actual final income tax to be
charged in the future may differ from the relevant assets and liabilities recognized at the end of the reporting period and
the difference may affect income tax charged or credited, or deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period in which the
final income tax determined.
5) Fair value of financial instruments
The Group uses valuation techniques that include inputs that are not based on observable market data to estimate the fair
value of certain type of financial instruments. The Group makes judgements on the choice of various valuation methods
and assumptions based on the condition of the principal market at the end of the reporting period.
6) Measurement and useful lives of property, plant, equipment or intangible assets
When the Group acquires property, plant, equipment or intangible assets from a business combination, it is required to
estimate the fair value of the assets at the acquisition date and determine the useful lives of such assets for depreciation
and amortization.
7) Credit loss allowance
The Group sets credit loss allowance upon evaluation of impairment relating to account receivables and financial services
receivables as described in Note 2.(8). The precision in loss allowance is based on the estimation of expected cash flow
and assumptions and variables of risk measurement model used for the estimation.

(3) Fair value estimation
The Group categorizes the assets and liabilities measured at fair value into the following three-level fair value hierarchy
in accordance with the inputs used for fair value measurement.
 Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
 Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs)
Fair value measurements of financial instruments by fair value hierarchy levels as of December 31, 2024 are as follows.

(7) The Group recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the date of the event or change in
circumstances that caused the transfer. There are no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 for the year
ended December 31, 2024.
(8) Descriptions of the valuation techniques and the inputs used in the fair value measurements categorized within
Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are as follows.
- Currency forwards, options and swap
Fair value of currency forwards, options and swap is measured based on forward exchange rate quoted in the current
market at the end of the reporting period, which has the same remaining period of derivatives to be measured. If the
forward exchange rate, which has the same remaining period of currency forwards, options and swap, is not quoted
in the current market, fair value is measured using estimates of similar period of forward exchange rate by applying
interpolation method with quoted forward exchange rates.
As the inputs used to measure fair value of currency forwards, options and swap are supported by observable market
data, such as forward exchange rates, the Group classifies the estimates of fair value measurements of the currency
forwards, options and swap as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
- Interest rate swap
The discount rate and forward interest rate used to measure the fair value of interest rate swap are determined based
on an applicable yield curve derived from interest quoted in the current market at the end of the reporting period.
The fair value of interest rate swap was measured as a discount on the estimated future cash flows of interest rate
swap based on forward interest rates derived from the above method at an appropriate discount rate.
72
As the inputs used to measure fair value of interest rate swap are supported by observable market data, such as yield
curves, the Group classifies the estimates of fair value measurements of the interest rate swap as Level 2 of the fair
value hierarchy.
- Debt instruments including corporate bonds
Fair value of debt instruments including corporate bonds is measured applying discounted cash flow methos. The
rate used to discount cash flows is determined based on swap rate and credit spreads of debt instruments, which have
the similar credit rating and period quoted in the current market with those of debt instruments including corporate
bonds that should be measured. The Group classifies fair value measurements of debt instruments including
corporate bonds as Level 2 of the fair-value hierarchy since the rate, which has significant effects on fair value of
debt instruments including corporate bonds, is based on observable market data.
- Unlisted equity securities
Fair value of unlisted equity securities is measured using discounted cash flow projection and market approach, and
as for discounted cash flow projections, certain assumptions not based on observable market prices or rate, such as
sales growth rate, pre-tax operating income ratio and discount rate based on business plan and circumstance of
industry, are used to estimate the future cash flow. The discount rate used to discount the future cash flows, is
calculated by applying the Capital Asset Pricing Model, using the data of similar listed companies. The Group
determines that the effect of estimation and assumptions referred above affecting fair value of unlisted equity
securities is significant and classifies fair value measurements of unlisted securities as Level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy.
- Redeemable convertible preference share
Fair value of redeemable convertible preference share is measured based on the fair value, exercise price, maturity,
and the stock price volatility up to the maturity of the underlying asset, using the binomial option pricing model. The
discount rate used in the binomial option pricing model is applied by converting the rate of return on corporate bonds
with equivalent credit rating corresponding to the remaining maturity into a continuously compounding discount
rate, and the stock price volatility up to maturity uses historical volatility of proxy companies in similar industries
in response to the remaining maturity. The fair value of the underlying asset is assumed to be maintained until the
end of the current period after estimating the underlying asset value on the contracted date by inverting the
underlying asset value inherent in the terms of the transaction on the premise that the acquisition of related shares is
an orderly transaction and traded at fair value. The Group classifies the fair value measurement of redeemable
convertible preference share as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy based on the conclusion that the effect of the
above assumptions and estimates on the fair value of redeemable convertible preference share is significant.
73
(9) The quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements
categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the description of relationships of significant
unobservable inputs to the fair value are as follows:

The Group does not expect changes in significant unobservable inputs would have a significant impact on the fair value,
taking into account reasonable alternative assumptions.
(10) Supplier financing agreement
The Group uses supplier financing agreements to manage working capital efficiently in transactions with specific
suppliers. Under these agreements, financial institutions prepay amounts to suppliers based on the Group’s credit, and the
Group repays the financial institutions after a certain period of time. The amounts directly paid by the financial institution
to suppliers under the agreements are recognized as either the Group’s borrowings or accounts payable.

to manage the Group’s capital. The overall capital risk management policy is consistent with that of the prior period.
Debt to equity ratios as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows.
Description December 31, 2024 December 31, 2023

(2) Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to various financial risks such as market risk (foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and price
risk), credit risk and liquidity risk related to its financial instruments. The purpose of risk management of the Group is to
identify potential risks related to financial performance and reduce, eliminate and avoid those risks to an acceptable level
of risks to the Group. Overall, the Group’s financial risk management policy is consistent with the prior period policy.
89
1) Market risk
The Group is mainly exposed to financial risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Accordingly, the Group uses financial derivative contracts to hedge and manage its interest rate risk and foreign currency
risk.
a) Foreign exchange risk management
The Group is exposed to various foreign exchange risks by making transactions in foreign currencies. The Group is
mainly exposed to foreign exchange risk in USD, EUR, JPY and others.
The Group manages foreign exchange risk by matching the inflow and the outflow of foreign currencies according to
each currency and maturity, and by adjusting the foreign currency settlement date based on its exchange rate forecast.
The Group uses foreign exchange derivatives, such as currency forward, currency swap, and currency option, as hedging
instruments. However, speculative foreign exchange trade on derivative financial instruments is prohibited.
Sensitivity analysis for a 5% change in exchange rate of the functional currency against each foreign currency on profit
before income tax as of December 31, 2024 is as follows.

EUR 41,147 (41,147)
JPY (1,905) 1,905
b) Interest rate risk management
The Group has borrowings with fixed or variable interest rates. Also, the Group is exposed to interest rate risk arising
from financial instruments with variable interest rates. To manage the interest rate risk, the Group maintains an appropriate
balance between borrowings with fixed and variable interest rates for short-term borrowings and has a policy to borrow
funds with fixed interest rates to avoid the future cash flow fluctuation risk for long-term debt if possible. The Group
manages its interest rate risk through regular assessments of the change in market conditions and the adjustments in nature
of its interest rates.
Sensitivity analysis for a 1% change in interest rates on profit before income tax as of December 31, 2024 is as follows.

Borrowings and debentures (166,588) 166,588
The Company’s subsidiaries, HYUNDAI CARD CO., LTD. and HYUNDAI CAPITAL SERVICES, INC. that are
operating financial business, are managing interest rate risk by utilizing value at risk (VaR). VaR is defined as a threshold
value which is a statistical estimate of the maximum potential loss based on normal distribution. As of December 31,
2024 and December 31, 2023, the amounts of interest rate risk measured at VaR are ￦339,281 million and ￦146,303

amounts of financial assets measured at FVPL and financial assets measured at FVOCI are ￦54,030 million
and ￦2,818,381 million, respectively.
90
2) Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk when a counterparty defaults on its contractual obligation resulting in a financial loss
for the Group. The Group operates a policy to transact with counterparties who only meet a certain level of credit rating
which was evaluated based on the counterparty’s financial conditions, default history, and other factors. The credit risk
in the liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited as the Group transacts only with financial institutions
with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. Except for the guarantee of indebtedness
discussed in Note 36, the book value of financial assets in the consolidated financial statements represents the maximum
amounts of exposure to credit risk.
In addition, the Company’s subsidiaries, HYUNDAI CARD CO., LTD. and HYUNDAI CAPITAL SERVICES, INC., that
operate financial business, assess their credit stability according to their internal credit ratings and manage credit risk
concentrations by debtor. These subsidiaries provide loan agreements with a limit to a large number of customers, and as
of December 31, 2024, the unused limit is ￦555,089 million for HYUNDAI CAPITAL SERVICES, INC. and ￦82,595,282
million for HYUNDAI CARD CO., LTD. and as of December 31, 2024, credit risk concentration relates to 86% for
households and 14% for companies.
3) Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk based on maturity profile of its funding. The Group analyses and reviews actual cash
outflow and its budget to match the maturity of its financial liabilities to that of its financial assets.
The Group retains an appropriate level of deposit to cope with uncertainty caused by the inherent nature of the industry
which is sensitive to economic fluctuation and to invest in R&D constantly. In addition, the Group has agreements with
financial institutions related to trade financing and overdraft to mitigate any significant unexpected market deterioration.
Also, the Group continues to strengthen its credit rates to secure a stable financing capability.
The Group’s maturity analysis of its non-derivative liabilities according to their remaining contract period before maturity
as of December 31, 2024 is as follows.

interest swaps to hedge its exposure to changes in foreign exchange rate or interest rate.

instruments and changes in the valuation of its other non-hedging derivative instruments and others.
In addition, the Company’s subsidiaries, HYUNDAI CARD CO., LTD. and HYUNDAI CAPITAL SERVICES, INC., that are
engaged in financial services business, use interest rate swaps and currency swaps to hedge the risks of future cash flows,

The Shareholders and Board of Directors
Opinion on internal control over financial reporting for consolidation purposes
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”) of Hyundai Motor Company (the
“Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Group”) for consolidation purposes based on
the Conceptual Framework for Design and Operation of ICFR established by the Operating Committee of ICFR
in Korea (the “ICFR Committee”) as of December 31, 2024.
In our opinion, the Group's ICFR for consolidation purposes has been effectively designed and operated, in all
material respects, as of December 31, 2024 in accordance with the Conceptual Framework for Design and
Operation of ICFR.
We also have audited, in accordance with Korean Standards on Auditing (“KSA”), the consolidated statement
of financial position as of December 31, 2024, and the consolidated statement of income, consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement
of cash flows for the year then ended, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material
accounting policy information, and our report dated March 5, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for opinion on ICFR for consolidation purposes
We conducted our audit in accordance with KSA. Our responsibilities under those standards are further

appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of ICFR for consolidation purposes
Our responsibility is to express an opinion of the Group’s ICFR for consolidation purposes based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with KSA. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective ICFR for consolidation purposes was maintained in all
material respects.
An audit of the ICFR for consolidation purposes involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence as to
whether a material weakness exists. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the
assessment of the risks that a material weakness exists. An audit also includes testing and evaluating the
design and operation of ICFR for consolidation purposes based on obtaining an understanding of ICFR for
consolidation purposes and the assessed risk.
ICFR for consolidation purposes definition and inherent limitations
The Group`s ICFR for consolidation purposes is implemented by those charged with governance,
management, and other employees and is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the Republic of Korea (“KIFRS”).
The Group`s ICFR for consolidation purposes includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with KIFRS,
and that receipts and expenditures of the Company and its subsidiaries are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the Company and its subsidiaries’ assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, ICFR for consolidation purposes may not prevent or detect misstatements
of the consolidated financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that ICFR for consolidation purposes may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
