Experiment No. 1: Realization of Basic gates (AND,OR,NOT) from Universal Gates(NAND &
NOR).

Objectives: To realize the operation of basic gates(AND,OR,NOT) using Universal logic gates.
Theory:

Universal Gates

A universal gate is a gate which can implement any Boolean function without need to use any
other gate. The NAND and NOR gates are universal gates. In practice, this is advantageous

since NAND and NOR gates are economical and easier to fabricate and are the basic gates used
in all IC digital logic families.

NAND Gate

The NAND gate represents the complement of the AND operation. Its name is an abbreviation of
NOT AND. The symbol for the NAND gate consists of an AND symbol with a bubble on the
output, denoting that a complement operation is performed on the output of the AND gate.

Objectives: To Implement the given Boolean function using logic gates in both SOP
and POS forms,
i) AB+BC
ii)(A+B).(B+C)

Theory:
Sum Of Products Form (SOP):

of logic gates. In this SOP form of Boolean function representation, the variables are operated by
AND (product) to form a product term and all these product terms are ORed (summed or added)

together to get the final function, Each ANDed term in SOP form is called Minterm.

Product Of Sum Form (POS):

these sum terms are ANDed (multiplied) together to get the product-of-sum form. This form is
exactly opposite to the SOP form. So this can also be said as “Dual of SOP form”. Each ORed

term in POS form is called Maxterm.

Experiment No. 4: | Implementation and Verification of Decoder, Encoder, Multiplexer,
Demultiplexer Circuit
Objective: To implement and verify simple Decoder, Encoder, Multiplexer and
Demultiplexer.

Theory:

Decoder:

A n-to-2" decoder takes an n-bit input and produces 2" outputs. The n inputs represent a binary
number that determines which of the 2" output is uniquely true. Decoders are simply a collection
of logic gates which are arranged in a specific way so as to breakdown any combination of inputs
to a set of terms that are all set to '0' apart from one term.

Encoder:

The decimal to binary encoder usually consists of 10 input lines and 4 output lines. Each input
line corresponds to the each decimal digit and 4 outputs correspond to the BCD code. This
encoder accepts the decoded decimal data as an input and encodes it to the BCD output which is
available on the output lines.

Multiplexer:

A multiplexer, abbreviated mux, is a device that has multiple inputs and one output. A data
selector, more commonly called a Multiplexer. They connect or control, multiple input lines
called "channels" consisting of either 2, 4, 8 or 16 individual inputs, one at a time to an output.
Multiplexers are used as one method of reducing the number of logic gates required in a circuit
or when a single data line is required to carry two or more different digital signals.

Generally, multiplexers have an even number of data inputs (2" ), a number of select lines (n)
that correspond with the number of data inputs and according to the binary condition of these
select lines, the appropriate data input is connected directly to the output.

Demultiplexer:

The process of getting information from one input and transmitting the same over one of many
outputs is called Demultiplexing. If you recall the Multiplexer tutorial, there we discussed the
concept of Multiplexing. Demultiplexing is just the opposite of that.A Demultiplexer is a
combinational logic circuit that receives the information on a single input line and transmits the
same information over one of ‘n’ possible output lines. In order to select a particular output, we
have to use a set of Select Lines and the bit combinations of these select lines control the
selection of specific output line to be connected to the input at a given instant,

Experiment No §: Verification of the state tables of RS-JK, D and T flip-flops using

Universal logic gates.

Objectives: To realize the operation of RS-JK, D and T flip-flops using Universal logic
gates.

Theory :
Sequential Logic Basics

In Sequential Logic the change of state depends not only on the actual inputs being applied to
their inputs at that time, but also on the previous output states. Sequential logic circuits are
generally termed as two state or Bistable devices which can have their output or outputs set in
one of two basic states, a logic level "1" or a logic level "0" and will remain unchanged
indefinitely in this current state or condition until some other input trigger pulse or signal is
applied which will cause the bistable to change its state once again.

The word "Sequential" means that things happen in a "sequence", one after another and in
Sequential Logic circuits, the actual clock signal determines when things will happen next.
Simple sequential logic circuits can be constructed from standard Bistable circuits such as Flip-
flops, Latches and Counters and which themselves can be made by simply connecting together
universal NAND Gates and/or NOR Gates in a particular combinational way to produce the

required sequential circuit.

There are mainly four types of flip flops that are used in electronic circuits. They are

1. The basic Flip Flop or S-R Flip Flop
2. Delay Flip Flop [D Flip Flop]
3. J-K Flip Flop
4. T Flip Flop
SR Flip-Flo

The SR flip-flop can be considered as one of the most basic sequential logic circuit possible.
This simple flip-flop is basically a one-bit memory bistable device that has two inputs, one which

MCKVIE/Digital Electronics Lab/ES-EC392,——

Lo re,

a nn no ae Se Me ee ee Oe Se OD DO

WY ft

ee a a

will "SET" the device (meaning. the output = "I"), and is labeled S and another which will
"RESET" the device (meaning the output = "0"), labeled R.

Then the SR description stands for "Sct-Reset". A basie NAND gate SR flip-flop circuit
provides feedback from both of its outputs back to its opposing inputs and is commonly used in
Memory circuits to store a single data bit. The term "Flip-flop" relates to the actual operation of
the device, as it can be "flipped" into one logic Set state or "flopped" back into the opposing
logic Reset state.

JK Flip-flop

This simple JK flip-Flop is the most widely used of all the flip-flop designs and is considered to
be a universal flip-flop circuit. The sequential operation of the JK flip-flop is exactly the same as
for the previous SR flip-flop with the same "Set" and "Reset" inputs. The difference this time is
that the JK flip-flop has no invalid or forbidden input states of the SR Latch (when S and R are
both 1).

The circuit includes two 3-input NAND gates. The output Q of the flip flop is returned back as a
feedback to the input of the NAND along with other inputs like K and clock pulse [CP].
Similarly output Q’ of the flip flop is given as a feedback to the input of the NAND along with
other inputs like J and clock pulse [CP].

D Flip-flop

D flip flop is actually a slight modification of the above explained clocked SR flip-flop. The D
input is connected to the S input and the complement of the D input is connected to the R input.
The D input is passed to the output of the flip flop when the value of CP is ’1'.

T Flip-Flop

In T flip flop, "T" defines the term "Toggle". The "T Flip Flop" has only one input, which is
constructed by connecting the input of JK flip flop. This single input is called T.

Experiment No. 6: Design of Shifi Register using D Flip Flop

Objective : To design a Shift Register using D Flip Flop and verification of truth table.

Theory:

Shift registers are a type of sequential logic circuit, mainly for storage of digital data. They are a group of
flip-flops connected in a chain so that the output from one flip-flop becomes the input of the next flip-
flop. All the flip-flops are driven by a common clock, and all are set or reset simultaneously. The serial
in/serial out shift register accepts data serially — that is, one bit at a time on a single line. It produces the
stored information on its output also in serial form. The serial in/parallel out shift register accepts data
serially — that is, one bit at a time on a single line. It produces the stored information on its output in
parallel form. The parallel in/serial out shift register accepts data in parallel. It produces the stored
information on its output also in serial form. The parallel in/parallel out shift register accepts data in
parallel. It produces the stored information on its output in parallel form.

Experiment No 7: Realization of Asynchronous Up/Down counter.
Objectives: To realize the operation of Asynchronous Up/Down counter.
Theory :

A counter is a sequential cireuit with a set of flip flop which counts the number of pulses given at
the clock input. The number of flip-flops determines the count limit or number of states.

(No of states = 2 7° of Mp Mops)

In asynchronous counter only the first flip-flop is clocked by an external clock. All subsequent
flip-flops are clocked by the output of the preceding flip-flop. Asynchronous counters are slower
than synchronous counters because of the delay in the transmission of the pulses from flip-flop to
flip-flop. Asynchronous counters are also called ripple-counters because of the way the clock
pulse nipples it way through the flip-flops.

A up /down asynchronous counter must be able to count both up and down. The circuit below is
a 2-bit up-down counter. It counts up or down depending on the status of the control signal M.
When the M input is at 0, the OR and AND network between FFO and FF1 will gate the non-
inverted output (Q) of FFO to the clock input of FFl. Thus the counter will count up.

When the M input is at 1, the OR and AND network between FFO and FF1 will gate the inverted
output (Q) of FFO to the clock input of FF1. Thus the counter will count down.

Experiment No 8: Realization of Synchronous Up/Down counter.
Objectives: To realize the Operation of Synchronous Up/Down counter.
Theory :

A counter is a sequential circuit with a set of flip flop which counts the number of pulses given at
the clock input. The number of flip-flops determines the count limit or number of states.

(No of states = 2 ° of flip Mops)

Here all the flip-flops are clocked simultaneously by an external clock. Synchronous counters are
faster than asynchronous counters because of the simultaneous clocking. Synchronous counters
are an example of state machine design because they have a set of states and a set of transition
tules for moving between those states after each clocked event.

A up /down synchronous counter must be able to count both up and down. The circuit below is a
2-bit up-down counter. It counts up or down depending on the status of the control signal M.
When the M input is at 0, the OR and AND network between FFO and FF1 will gate the non-
inverted output (Q) of FFO to the J and K inputs of FF1. Thus the counter will count up.

When the M input is at 1, the OR and AND network between FFO and FF1 will gate the inverted
output (Q) of FFO to the J and K input of FF1. Thus the counter will count down.

Experiment No 9: Realization of Ring counter & Johnson’s counter.
Objectives: To realize the operation of Ring counter & Johnson’s counter.
Theory:

Ring Counter:

Ring counters are implemented using shift registers. It is essentially a circulating shift register
connected so that the last flip-flop shifts its value into the first flip-flop. There is usually only a
single 1 circulating in the register, as long as clock pulses are applied. (Starts
100>010>001 repeat). To initialize the operation of the ring counter, it is necessary to set the first
flip-flop and reset second and third flip flops simultaneously as shown in the figure.

Johnson Counter:

The Johnson counter, also known as the twisted-ring counter, is exactly the same as the ring
counter except that the inverted output of the last flip-flop is connected to the input of the first
flip-flop. Let’s say, starts from 000, 100, 110, 111, O11 and 001, and the sequence is repeated so
long as there is input pulse. To initialize the operation of the Johnson counter, it is necessary to
reset all flip-flops, as shown in the figure.

Observe that neither the Johnson nor the ring counter will generate the desired counting sequence
if not initialized properly.

Experiment No. 10: Study of D/A Converter and A/D Converter Circuit

Objective : To study the characteristics of DAC using R-2R ladder circuit and To
study the characteristics of ADC 0804,

DAC:
Theory :

Digital to analog and analog to digital conversion form two very important aspects of digital
data processing. As an example the output of digital system may be changed to analog form for
the purpose of driving a pen recorder. In this case a digital to analog converter (DAC) is
necessary. DAC converts a digital signal into an equivalent analog voltage. Two convenient
methods of converting digital signals are

1. Binary weighted network. Q
2. Binary ladder network.

Binary ladder network
The binary ladder is resistive network whose output voltage is a proper sum of the digital inputs.

The resistors used here have two values and thus overcomes one of the objections to the binary
weighted network. Such a ladder designed for 4 bits, is shown in Figure.

If we study the network, we can conclude that the total equivalent resistance looking from any
node (A or B or C or D) back toward the terminating resistor or out toward the digital input is
2R. This is true regardless of whether the digital inputs are at ground or +V .The conclusion is
true assuming that the digital inputs are ideal voltage sources.

(Zero internal impedance).

We can use this characteristics to determine the output voltages for various digital inputs.

Starting from LSB each bit of DAC has weight (V/16, (V/8), (V/4) and (V/2) Volts respectively,
where V is the voltage input to each bit of DAC.

An OPAMP in voltage follower mode can be used at the output as it has high input impedance so
that the circuitry connected at the output will not load the resistance network.

ADC:

Theory:

(B) The process of converting an analog voltage into an equivalent digital signal ts
known as analog to digital conversion (ADC). This operation is somewhat more
complicated than converse operation of D/A Conversion. A number of different
methods have been developed which are

(C) (a) Simultancous conversion type

(D) (b) Ramp type.

(E) (c) Successive approximation type.

(F) (d) Integrating type. ‘

(G) (ec) Counter type.

(H) (f) Dual slope type.
Successive approximation type ADC and integrating type ADC are most common. In our

experiment we have used ADC 0804 Chip, which is a successive approximation type
ADC. It has 8-bit digital output, one channel analog input; one reference voltage has to

be supplied to it.
