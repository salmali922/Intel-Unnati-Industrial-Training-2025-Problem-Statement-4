Guidance on the Documentation Requirements of ISO 9001:2008
1 Introduction
Two of the most important objectives in the revision of the ISO 9000 series of standards have been
a) to develop a simplified set of standards that will be equally applicable to small as well as
medium and large organizations, and
b) for the amount and detail of documentation required to be more relevant to the desired results
of the organization’s process activities.
ISO 9001:2008 Quality management systems – Requirements has achieved these objectives, and the
purpose of this additional guidance is to explain the intent of the new standard with specific regard to
documentation.
ISO 9001:2008 allows an organization flexibility in the way it chooses to document its quality
management system (QMS). This enables each individual organization to develop the minimum
amount of documentation needed in order to demonstrate the effective planning, operation and control
of its processes and the implementation and continual improvement of the effectiveness of its QMS.
It is stressed that ISO 9001 requires (and always has required) a “Documented quality management
system”, and not a “system of documents”.
2 What is a “document”? - Definitions and references
The following are some of the main objectives of an organization’s documentation, independent of
whether or not it has implemented a formal QMS;
a) Communication of Information
- as a tool for information transmission and communication. The type and extent of the
documentation will depend on the nature of the organization’s products and processes, the
degree of formality of communication systems and the level of communication skills within
the organization, and the organizational culture.
b) Evidence of conformity
- provision of evidence that what was planned, has actually been done.
c) Knowledge sharing
- to disseminate and preserve the organization’s experiences. A typical example would be a
technical specification, which can be used as a base for design and development of a new
product.
A list of commonly used terms relating to documentation is presented in Annex A (taken from ISO
9000:2005). It must be stressed that, according to ISO 9001:2008 clause 4.2 Documentation
requirements documents may be in any form or type of medium, and the definition of “document” in
ISO 9000:2005 clause 3.7.2 gives the following examples:
− paper

3 ISO 9001:2008 Documentation Requirements
ISO 9001:2008 clause 4.1 General requirements requires an organization to “establish, document,
implement, and maintain a quality management system and continually improve its effectiveness in
accordance with the requirements of this International Standard”
Clause 4.2.1 General explains that the quality management system documentation shall include:
a) documented statements of a quality policy and quality objectives;
b) a quality manual
c) documented procedures required by this International Standard
d) documents needed by the organization to ensure the effective planning, operation and control of its
processes, and
e) records required by this International Standard;
The notes after Clause 4.2 make it clear that where the standard specifically requires a “documented
procedure”, the procedure has to be established, documented, implemented and maintained. It also
emphasizes that the extent of the QMS documentation may differ from one organization to another due
to:
− the size of organization and type of activities;
− the complexity of processes and their interactions, and
− the competence of personnel.
All the documents that form part of the QMS have to be controlled in accordance with clause 4.2.3 of
ISO 9001:2008, or, for the particular case of records, according to clause 4.2.4.
4 Guidance on Clause 4.2 of ISO 9001:2008
The following comments are intended to assist users of ISO 9001:2008 in understanding the intent of
the general documentation requirements of the International Standard.
a) Documented statements of a quality policy and objectives:
− Requirements for the quality policy are defined in clause 5.3 of ISO 9001:2008. The
documented quality policy has to be controlled according to the requirements of clause
4.2.3.
Note Organizations that are revising their quality policy for the first time, or in order to meet the
amended requirements in ISO 9001:2008, should pay particular attention to clause 4.2.3 (c), (d)
and (g).
− Requirements for quality objectives are defined in clause 5.4.1 of ISO 9001:2008. These
documented quality objectives are also subject to the document control requirements of
clause 4.2.3.
b) Quality Manual:
− Clause 4.2.2 of ISO 9001:2008 specifies the minimum content for a quality manual. The
format and structure of the manual is a decision for each organization, and will depend on

the organization’s size, culture and complexity. Some organizations may choose to use the
quality manual for other purposes besides that of simply documenting the QMS
− A small organization may find it appropriate to include the description of its entire QMS
within a single manual, including all the documented procedures required by the standard.
− Large, multi-national organizations may need several manuals at the global, national or
regional level, and a more complex hierarchy of documentation.
− The quality manual is a document that has to be controlled in accordance with the
requirements of clause 4.2.3.
c) Documented procedures:
− ISO 9001:2008 specifically requires the organization to have “documented procedures” for
the following six activities:
 4.2.3 Control of documents
 4.2.4 Control of records
 8.2.2 Internal audit
 8.3 Control of nonconforming product
 8.5.2 Corrective action
 8.5.3 Preventive action
− These documented procedures have to be controlled in accordance with the requirements
of clause 4.2.3
− Some organizations may find it convenient to combine the procedure for several activities
into a single documented procedure (for example, corrective action and preventive action).
Others may choose to document a given activity by using more than one documented
procedure (for example, internal audits). Both are acceptable.
− Some organizations (particularly larger organizations, or those with more complex
processes) may require additional documented procedures (particularly those relating to
product realization processes) to implement an effective QMS.
− Other organizations may require additional procedures, but the size and/or culture of the
organization could enable these to be effectively implemented without necessarily being
documented. However, in order to demonstrate compliance with ISO 9001:2008, the
organization has to be able to provide objective evidence (not necessarily documented)
that its QMS has been effectively implemented.
d) Documents needed by the organization to ensure the effective planning, operation and control
of its processes:
− In order for an organization to demonstrate the effective implementation of its QMS, it may
be necessary to develop documents other than documented procedures. However, the
only documents specifically mentioned in ISO 9001:2008 are:
 Quality policy (clause 4.2.1.a)
 Quality objectives (clause 4.2.1.a)
 Quality manual (clause 4.2.1.b)
− There are several requirements of ISO 9001:2008 where an organization could add value
to its QMS and demonstrate conformity by the preparation of other documents, even
though the standard does not specifically require them. Examples may include:
 Process maps, process flow charts and/or process descriptions
 Organization charts
 Specifications
 Work and/or test instructions
 Documents containing internal communications
 Production schedules
 Approved supplier lists
 Test and inspection plans
 Quality plans
− All such documents have to be controlled in accordance with the requirements of clause
4.2.3 and/or 4.2.4, as applicable
e) Records:
− Examples of records specifically required by ISO 9001:2008 are presented in Annex B.

ISO 9000 Introduction and Support Package:
Guidance on the Documentation Requirements of ISO 9001:2008
− Organizations are free to develop other records that may be needed to demonstrate
conformity of their processes, products and quality management system.
− Requirements for the control of records are different from those for other documents, and
all records have to be controlled according to those of clause 4.2.4 of ISO 9001:2008.
5 Organizations preparing to implement a QMS
For organizations that are in the process of implementing a QMS, and wish to meet the requirements
of ISO 9001:2008, the following comments may be useful.
− For organizations that are in the process of implementing or have yet to implement a QMS,
ISO 9001:2008 emphasizes a process approach. This includes:
 determining the processes necessary for the effective implementation of the
quality management system
 determining the interactions between these processes.
 documenting the processes to the extent necessary to assure their effective
operation and control. (It may be appropriate to document the processes using
process maps. It is emphasized, however, that documented process maps are not
a requirement of ISO 9001:2008.)
− These processes include the management, resource, product realization and
measurement processes that are relevant to the effective operation of the QMS.
− Analysis of the processes should be the driving force for defining the amount of
documentation needed for the quality management system, taking into account the
requirements of ISO 9001:2008. It should not be the documentation that drives the
processes.
6 Organizations wishing to adapt an existing QMS
For organizations that currently have a QMS the following comments are intended to assist in
understanding the changes to documentation that may be required or facilitated by the transition to ISO
9001:2008
− An organization with an existing QMS should not need to rewrite all of its documentation in
order to meet the requirements of ISO 9001:2008. This is particularly true if an
organization has structured its QMS based on the way it effectively operates, using a
process approach. In this case, the existing documentation may be adequate and can be
simply referenced in the revised quality manual.
− An organization that has not used a process approach in the past will need to pay
particular attention to the definition of its processes, their sequence and interaction.
− An organization may be able to carry out some simplification and/or consolidation of
existing documents, in order to simplify its QMS.
7 Demonstrating conformity with ISO 9001:2008
For organizations wishing to demonstrate conformity with the requirements of ISO 9001:2008, for the
purposes of certification/registration, contractual, or other reasons, it is important to remember the
need to provide evidence of the effective implementation of the QMS.
− Organizations may be able to demonstrate conformity without the need for extensive
documentation.
− To claim conformity with ISO 9001:2008, the organization has to be able to provide
objective evidence of the effectiveness of its processes and its quality management
system. Clause 3.8.1 of ISO 9000:2005 defines “objective evidence” as “data supporting
the existence or verity of something” and notes that “objective evidence may be obtained
through observation, measurement, test, or other means.”

ISO 9000 Introduction and Support Package:
Guidance on the Documentation Requirements of ISO 9001:2008
− Objective evidence does not necessarily depend on the existence of documented
procedures, records or other documents, except where specifically mentioned in ISO
9001:2008. In some cases, (for example, in clause 7.1(d) Planning of product realization,
and clause 8.2.4 Monitoring and measurement of product), it is up to the organization to
determine what records are necessary in order to provide this objective evidence.
− Where the organization has no specific internal procedure for a particular activity, and this
is not required by the standard, (for example, clause 5.6 Management Review), it is
acceptable for this activity to be conducted using as a basis the relevant clause of ISO
9001:2008. In these situations, both internal and external audits may use the text of ISO
9001:2008 for conformity assessment purposes.
