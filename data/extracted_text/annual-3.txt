The Amazon Conservation Team
Founders' Letter
As we reflect on another very productive year in nearly three
decades of working hand-in-hand with indigenous and other
local communities to protect the Amazon, we are filled with
gratitude for your unwavering support. Together, we are
preserving not only a biome, but also ways of life that are deeply
intertwined with the earth, the rainforests, the waters, and
ancestors.
We want to draw your attention to a group of individuals whose
invaluable contributions to conservation often go unrecognized:
indigenous women.

4/17/25, 5:54 PM 2023 Annual Report
Indigenous women have always been keepers of traditional
knowledge passed down through the generations. Their unique
connection to the territory as life-givers and caretakers endows
them with a profound understanding of the delicate balance that
sustains life in the Amazon, an awareness that guides their
actions as they confront deforestation, climate change, and
colonization.
Numerous studies have shown that when women are at the
lead, projects achieve greater success in biodiversity
conservation, ecological restoration, and community resilience.
Further, research indicates that women often bring greater
inclusivity, solidarity, empathy, and equity to initiatives, building
stronger community engagement as a result.
But it is not just their knowledge—it is their resilience and
tenacity in the face of adversity. Time and again, we have
witnessed these women demonstrate remarkable leadership,
mobilizing their communities to defend their forests, nurture
their lifeways, and rebuild after crisis with courage and unity.
Theirs is a labor of love, rooted in a deep sense of responsibility
to future generations and a commitment to preserving the
Amazon for all beings. And it is interwoven throughout all of our
work at ACT—touching on leadership, community health, and
cultural health. Some of our joint achievements with indigenous
women in 2023 include:
Increasing the capacity of the Union of Indigenous Women of
the Brazilian Amazon (UMIAB), a group dedicated to
defending the rights of indigenous women and children
across the Brazilian Amazon, to design and lead goal-oriented
projects
Tripling the revenue of over 70 beekeeping families and
increasing production of both propolis and honey by 250% in
Suriname
Developing a pilot plan for comprehensive maternal perinatal
care as part of our intercultural public healthcare initiative in

As we celebrate the achievements of 2023, let us honor the vital
role that indigenous women play in shaping the future of our
planet—their resilience, their wisdom, and their tireless
dedication to conservation. And let us pledge to stand in
solidarity with them as we continue our shared mission to
protect planet, people, and spirit in Amazonia and beyond.

Where We Work
We are a field-based organization. Before we work anywhere, we
first must be invited; in effect, we do not choose our partners,
they choose us. Because the protection of water is of supreme
importance to our partners, our work areas are frequently
defined by the presence of headwaters and watersheds.

Our Strategies
Through our holistic three-pronged strategic approach, we
advance conservation initiatives that honor the interdependent
relationship between forests and their people. The following
pages highlight 2023 ACT initiatives that correspond to these
overarching strategies.
Land
Conserving rainforests and ancestral
territories
We ensure the restoration, stewardship,
and protection of priority ecosystems
and resources (both ecologically and
culturally significant) by indigenous and
local peoples, to ensure the long-term
health and biodiversity of their lands.
Livelihoods
Improving the physical well-being of
communities
We advance collective access to critical
services, necessities, and infrastructure,
and promote sustainable local economies and income-
generation systems, to support the permanence of indigenous
and local peoples in their territories.
Governance
Supporting the self-determination and living cultures of our
partners
We promote the ability of our partner communities to govern
themselves and their territory, exercise their rights, and revitalize

their living cultural heritage, practices, and knowledge.
ACT's Cumulative Impact
Across geographies and cultures, we work with many partner
communities on diverse, bio-cultural initiatives to protect
ancestral rainforests, support cultural revitalization, and expand
indigenous self-determination. Together we co-create methods
that center each community's unique priorities, challenges, and
worldviews. This dynamic approach produces holistic impacts
that often resist distillation into quantitative metrics. However,
the following figures quantify a small sampling of achievements
facilitated, directly supported, or executed by ACT.

Expanding the Recognition of Indigenous Territories
1
For centuries, the territories of indigenous peoples in South America have been
encroached upon and devastated. Each loss of land means the erosion of
cultural identity, knowledge, and unique ways of life. At the Amazon Conservation
Team, we collaborate closely with indigenous communities to restore their
traditional territories. Restoring indigenous leadership over ancestral rainforests is
not only vital for the cultural and physical well-being of these communities but
also the most effective way to combat deforestation, sequester carbon, and
safeguard biodiversity in Amazonia.
In 2023, with our technical and legal expertise, six existing indigenous reserves
were expanded, and five new indigenous reserves were created in Colombia. The
formal recognition of these ancestral territories helps achieve territorial justice for
almost 4,500 individuals from nine ethnic groups. In total, more than 88,000
acres of ancestral territory were returned to indigenous hands in 2023, adding to
the 2.6 million acres of indigenous reserve land we have already helped
indigenous peoples formally establish.

Restoring Fragmented Ecosystems Through Agroforestry
2
Colombia’s Caquetá department, a region heavily impacted by deforestation,
witnesses the loss of hundreds of acres of forest annually due to timber
extraction, cattle ranching, and monoculture production. ACT is dedicated to
reversing this trend by transforming livestock pastures and monoculture farms
into vibrant, biodiverse agroforestry systems. These initiatives not only create new
sources of income but also enhance forest cover and ecological connectivity,
allowing native wildlife and plant species to thrive.
Last year, ACT, in collaboration with local communities in the departments of
Caquetá and La Guajira, restored 4,500 acres of fragmented ecosystems. With
ACT’s technical guidance, 349 families embraced sustainable management
practices, including planting nearly 60,000 native trees, paving the way for a
more sustainable and prosperous future.
Centering Indigenous Practices in Healthcare

4/17/25, 5:54 PM 2023 Annual Report
Historically, Colombia’s universal healthcare system has been unable to serve the
unique needs of indigenous populations. Moreover, the imposition of strictly
Western healthcare not only has a lower chance of acceptance, but also
threatens further erasure of indigenous healthcare modalities.
ACT is supporting the Murui, Coreguaje, Pastos, Siona, and Emberá indigenous
peoples—representing more than 17,000 people—as they develop their own
autonomous healthcare systems (known as SISPI) integrated into the national
public indigenous health entity. We help strengthen the collaboration between
these groups and the government as they undertake this massive task, which
requires dialogues and agreements between indigenous authorities, regional
health departments, and local hospitals and universities. The stated
commitment of the Colombian government to include SISPI in the national
development plan is an important recognition of traditional medicine and
practices.
In 2023, 63 community members from eight communities were trained as
intercultural health promoters with ACT’s support. And we have accompanied 87
communities through the first development phase of the SISPI initiative, in
partnership with traditional authorities.

Bringing Clean Energy to the Amazon
4
How do we ensure that indigenous peoples in the remote Amazon have access
to clean energy? Many indigenous communities residing in these isolated areas
are disconnected from national electric grids and have historically depended on
diesel-powered generators. These generators, while functional, have significant
drawbacks, including the need for expensive and unsustainable fuel.
Recognizing the need for a more sustainable solution, we took proactive steps
across 2022 and 2023, facilitating the installation of 356 solar lamp kits across 34
communities situated in the middle and lower Caquetá River regions of Colombia
and the Loreto department of Peru. This initiative has had a profound impact,
benefiting over 1,500 individuals from more than 350 families. The adoption of
solar energy has not only provided a cleaner and more reliable source of light,
but also reduced their average energy costs by nearly two-thirds, marking a
significant improvement in their quality of life.
Uniting Ancestral Knowledge and Western Science to Protect Sea Turtles

https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/304ad428e4874739965911ad11c3d4a1/print 13/41
4/17/25, 5:54 PM 2023 Annual Report
By joining ancestral indigenous knowledge and Western scientific traditions, our
new coastal initiative, Ancestral Tides, is pioneering biocultural sea turtle
conservation across a network of indigenous communities from Colombia to
Mexico.
In 2023, this initiative saw the launch of three indigenous-led monitoring projects
and the construction of three sea turtle hatcheries, marking significant strides in
our goals. Ancestral Tides' dedicated network of indigenous tortugueros also
conducted over 500 beach patrols, tirelessly working to protect endangered sea
turtle species. Their efforts have led to the identification of more than 900 nests
across five beaches, a testament to the power of community-driven
conservation. Remarkably, over 660 of these nests were carefully relocated to
nurseries, ensuring successful hatching away from the threat of predation. This
initiative is not just about saving sea turtles; it is about honoring and integrating
the invaluable knowledge of indigenous communities for a brighter, more
sustainable future.
Mapping and Storytelling to Protect Ancestral Forests and Cultural
Knowledge

4/17/25, 5:54 PM 2023 Annual Report
The mapping and storytelling initiative of our ACT-Guianas program expanded to
Guyana and French Guiana in 2023, helping to strengthen four communities’
cultural links with their territories. Over a series of workshops, ACT introduced
mapping and storytelling methodologies to Aluku, Macushi, and Wayana
communities, conducted initial participatory mapping activities, and trained 37
community members in the use of audiovisual and mapping equipment and
software. Over 500 places were mapped, and more than 100 stories recorded.
This initiative plays a crucial role in revitalizing indigenous cultural heritage and
place-based knowledge, which are critical to cultural survival and the protection
of local rainforests. By capturing and preserving these stories and maps, we
honor the wisdom and traditions of indigenous communities, ensuring they are
passed down through generations. Mapping and storytelling work was also
advanced with Trio communities of southern Suriname, who have more than 150
stories and 50 places recorded for community use. This work enriches the
cultural tapestry of these communities and fortifies their connection to their
land.
Protecting Rainforests and Promoting Self-Determination through
Community Life Plans

4/17/25, 5:54 PM 2023 Annual Report
In Suriname, we are working closely with Trio indigenous villages in the Curuni
River watershed to facilitate their creation of community Life Plans, a
collaborative process first developed in our Colombia program. These plans,
written by the communities themselves, outline a path toward a future where
their forests are better protected, their communities are thriving, and the well-
being of their peoples is guaranteed. Addressing vital areas such as
environmental management, land use planning, healthcare, education,
governance, self-determination, and the preservation of cultural knowledge and
traditions, these Life Plans are a beacon of hope and progress. Where feasible,
the plans also seek integration of community objectives with regional
governmental planning and development.
In 2023, the village of Kwamalasamutu achieved a significant milestone by
completing their community Life Plan, celebrated in a high-profile national event
with Trio leaders, ACT, and the President of Suriname. Meanwhile, the
development of Life Plans is well underway in the additional Trio villages of
Sipaliwini, Alalaparu, Curuni, and Amatopo. This collaborative effort is not just a
plan but a powerful testament to the resilience, unity, and forward-thinking spirit
of the Trio communities.
Beekeeping to Sustain Livelihoods and Revitalize Cultural Knowledge

4/17/25, 5:54 PM 2023 Annual Report
Across our programs in Suriname, Colombia and Brazil, ACT supports partner
communities with stingless beekeeping initiatives, known as meliponiculture.
These initiatives promote honey and propolis as medicine and food, and
commercial harvesting when suitable. Stingless bee projects also encourage the
application and revitalization of cultural memory about native bees and the
protection of the standing forests required for these native bees to be productive.
In Suriname alone, 77 dedicated beekeepers across three villages are managing
around 400 hives of various species with our continuous technical training and
support. This collaborative effort has yielded remarkable results; over the past
year, the production of propolis, a medicinal plant resin, and honey has increased
by 250%, while profits per beekeeping family have tripled.
Structures for Strengthening Communities

4/17/25, 5:54 PM 2023 Annual Report
ACT's dedication to the well-being of our indigenous partner communities in
Brazil remains unwavering. In 2023, we made significant strides in Urunai, a
remote community in northern Brazil, by completing key stages of an ancestral
knowledge center. This multifaceted structure will serve as a traditional health
clinic and a venue for meetings, workshops, and cultural exchanges, providing a
haven for individuals from neighboring villages. This center will directly benefit
210 people from Urunai and the village of Kuxare, fostering a sense of unity and
cultural revitalization. Additionally, in the Xingu River region, ACT's support was
pivotal in constructing six traditional houses in the Ulupuene village after
devastating fires in 2023. Our commitment to rebuilding and strengthening these
communities underscores our mission to protect and uplift indigenous
communities, ensuring their resilience and continuity for generations to come.
Bolstering Indigenous Governance, Participation, and Empowerment

4/17/25, 5:54 PM 2023 Annual Report
Civic participation is critical for indigenous communities as their struggle for their
rights and the protection of their environment. In Brazil, in 2023, ACT supported
indigenous associations in their internal governance, collaborations with public
entities, and participation in major fora to raise the voice of indigenous peoples.
With a delegation of leaders from all villages of the Paraná do Boá Boá
Indigenous Territories, deep in the Amazon, ACT sponsored a workshop of the
regional indigenous organization APIAM on territorial monitoring, in collaboration
with the Brazilian governmental indigenous protection agency FUNAI and the
national public prosecutor’s office. Additionally, in the Xingu River region of central
Brazil, ACT provided support for the assembly of the Ulupuene Indigenous
Association. ACT also funded the participation of nine indigenous leaders from
four territories and the Xingu indigenous association ATIX in the Free Land Camp
—the largest indigenous mobilization in Brazil that has occurred since 2004,
numbering some 9,000 participants from more than 200 groups.
Recovery of Traditional Territory
11
https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/304ad428e4874739965911ad11c3d4a1/print 19/41
4/17/25, 5:54 PM 2023 Annual Report
In Brazil, ACT has supported the Ãwa indigenous people in their fight to achieve
the recovery of their traditional lands--the 70,000-acre Taego Ãwa Indigenous
Territory—from which they were violently captured and displaced in 1973. In 2016,
the Ministry of Justice recognized their possession of their ancestral territory, but
the government failed to fulfill its obligations to peacefully resettle ranchers and
land grabbers who had illegally occupied these lands. In 2023, the Ãwa reached
a major milestone through a court judgment that requires government agencies
to relocate settlers, an essential step in the restoration of the Ãwa’s rightful
ownership and the eventual restoration of this forest.
The broader context of this struggle highlights the pervasive problem of land
theft and environmental destruction driven by colonization and industrial
expansion. For Amazonian peoples, their land is vital for their physical well-being,
cultural identity, and ancestral knowledge. ACT's focus on territorial justice
addresses these challenges by ensuring indigenous communities not only regain
access to their lands but also secure stewardship and decision-making rights.
This approach supports high rates of forest cover, biodiversity, and carbon
sequestration, underscoring the importance of territorial justice for both the
survival of indigenous peoples and the health of our planet.

Financial Overview
In 2023, ACT continued to achieve significant programmatic
results and expanded geographies while focusing on our long-
term strategies and addressing the critical need to conserve the
Amazon and strengthen the communities that support its
protection.
From the financial perspective, the total revenue for 2023 was
~$13 million, representing a significant increase from the
previous year. This growth was driven primarily by securing new
multiyear grants from foundations. Externally, the investment
market slowly rebounded, and our returns recovered when
compared to 2022.
We carefully managed our expenses, which totaled ~$12 million,
a 13% increase over 2022 levels. We invested 80% in
conservation initiatives and 20% in strengthening core operations
across the organization, reflecting our dedication to sustaining a
lean and efficient operation, despite the challenging economic
conditions and inflationary trends, while remaining steadfast in
delivering on our 2025 strategic plan.
We extend our heartfelt gratitude to all our supporters as each
dollar contributed has made a difference in our conservation
efforts.This continued support has been vital in making a lasting
impact on our partner communities and the environment.

In Memoriam
Richard Kahn
Richard Kahn was a quiet visionary—a brilliant lawyer and activist
with a profound sense of social and environmental justice as well
as a believer in the therapeutic benefits of psychedelics in
healing.
At the end of 1995, Richard, a family foundation trustee, called to
ask why ACT’s precursorwas not presenting a proposal to
continue work that Mark Plotkin had begun in Colombia, focused
on strengthening the more traditional uses of ayahuasca with
shamans deep in the Amazon.
The founders told Richard that they were grateful for the offer
but did not have the necessary infrastructure. In his eloquent
deep voice, he replied, “Well, you find a way. The work is
important.” With this injection of belief and support, in 1996, ACT
was formally founded with a mission that holds today, still
advised by indigenous healers and elders.

4/17/25, 5:54 PM 2023 Annual Report
Across those early years, Richard steadfastly encouraged ACT to
continue bringing a new conservation paradigm of partnership
with indigenous people to the philanthropic world. Securing
funding for this novel approach was initially challenging, and
Richard would skillfully edit our proposals to better convince
foundations to support our work.
Richard’s counsel and inspiration was of enormous value to us
through and beyond the next quarter-century. We will miss
Richard dearly. His legacy lives on.
Danilo Villafañe
Danilo Villafañe, a forceful advocate for indigenous rights and
culture as well as an ACT partner, was an Arhuaco leader
renowned for his efforts to protect sacred indigenous lands in
Colombia’s Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta from deforestation and
colonization. He also served for a time as the governor of the
Arhuaco.
Danilo came from a lineage of activism: his father, Adalberto
Villafañe, was assassinated in 1996 while working to recover

Arhuaco lands from coca cultivators.
Per ACT President Mark Plotkin: “Danilo had an almost unique
ability to befriend people from all walks of life and all parts of the
economic and political spectrum. He was relentlessly cheerful
and dedicated, often in the face of daunting challenges and real
danger ... he died as he lived: a fearless hero, trying to help
others.”
