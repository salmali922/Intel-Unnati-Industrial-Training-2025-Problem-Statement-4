    "context_text": "Market and Business Overview\nMarket Trends and Strategy\nIn 2023, the automotive industry grew with an approximately 9% increase in global vehicle production year over year. We expect industry ADAS volumes to grow faster than\noverall global vehicle production in the coming years and anticipate long-term ADAS growth from increases in the percentage of vehicles that are equipped with basic ADAS\nfeatures from the factory. Despite our expectation for a decline in Mobileye ADAS volumes in 2024 due to a correction of inventory with our customers, we continue to believe we\nwill benefit from positive industry ADAS growth over the medium-term. In addition to potential volume growth, our portfolio of advanced solutions has the potential to drive higher\naverage system price over time.\nBeyond ADAS solutions, we believe that the availability of AVs will cause a significant transformation in mobility, including vehicle ownership and utilization. We expect that AV\ntechnology will eventually be accessed by consumers through shared-vehicle MaaS networks, as well as in consumer-owned and operated AVs. We are pursuing this market\ntrend by using our eyes-on/hands-off Mobileye SuperVision solution as a baseline to scale to our eyes-off/hands-off Mobileye Chauffeur consumer AV product in a variety of\noperational design domains.

To succeed, we will need to compete effectively across factors such as\navailability and time-to-market of manufacturing technology; advances in manufacturing processes in areas such as performance, performance per watt, and density; multi-chip\npackaging; system integration; manufacturing capacity; price; margin; ease of use; quality; yields; customer satisfaction; and ecosystem support. Building and maintaining a\ncompetitive foundry business requires high ongoing investments to maintain leading-edge process technology and manufacturing capacity, which investments in many instances\nmust be made ahead of customer commitments and may not be recouped. Moreover, many of the largest potential IFS customers are fabless semiconductor companies whose\nproducts compete with our own.

Our non-marketable equity\nsecurities had a carrying amount of $4.6 billion as of December\u00a030, 2023 ($4.6 billion as of December\u00a031, 2022) and include our investment in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. of\n$1.1\u00a0billion ($1.1 billion as of December\u00a031, 2022).\nCommodity Price Risk\nAlthough we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree.

The Company assesses inventory at each reporting date in order\nto assert that it is recorded at net realizable value, giving consideration to, among other factors: whether the\nproducts have achieved the substantive engineering milestones to qualify for sale to customers; the\ndetermination of normal capacity levels in its manufacturing process to determine which manufacturing\noverhead costs can be included in the valuation of inventory; whether the product is valued at the lower of\ncost or net realizable value; and the estimation of excess and obsolete inventory or that which is not of\nsaleable quality.\nAuditing management\u2019s assessment of net realizable value for inventory was challenging because the\ndetermination of excess and obsolete inventory reserves and lower of cost or net realizable value is\njudgmental and considers a number of factors that are affected by market and economic conditions, such as\ncustomer forecasts, dynamic pricing environments, and industry supply and demand.

We use a demand forecast to develop\nour short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when\ndeveloping these demand forecasts. We compare the estimate of future demand to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of\nobsolete or excess inventory. When our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we write off\namounts considered to be excess inventory.\nLong-Lived Assets\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nWe compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. We also capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures.\nCapitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that asset cost.\nAt least annually, we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property, plant, and equipment, considering factors such as the process\ntechnology cadence between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process\ntechnology.

Intel\nIn October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against us in the US District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that various Intel FPGA and\nprocessor products infringe eight patents VLSI acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). VLSI granted Intel a covenant not to sue on the two patents the court said can\nproceed to trial as it appeals losses it suffered earlier in the case on three other patents. VLSI has requested that the judge take the trial scheduled for March 2024 off calendar.\nIn April 2019, VLSI filed three infringement suits against us in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas accusing various of our processors of infringement of eight\nadditional patents it had acquired from NXP:\n\u25aa\nThe first Texas case went to trial in February 2021, and the jury awarded VLSI $1.5 billion for literal infringement of one patent and $675 million for infringement of\nanother patent under the doctrine of equivalents. In April 2022, the court entered final judgment, awarding VLSI $2.1 billion in damages and approximately $162.3\nmillion in pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. We appealed the judgment to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, including the court\u2019s rejection of Intel\u2019s claim to\nhave a license from Fortress Investment Group\u2019s acquisition of Finjan.

The German Federal Patent Court\u2019s final decision on invalidity is\nexpected in October 2024. In December 2023, the court in Dusseldorf held a trial on the issue of infringement, and will hand down a decision in February 2024. If defendants lose\nat trial in Germany, the Dusseldorf Regional Court could impose an injunction and recall order prohibiting sales of some or all of the accused products, and potentially other\nproducts, in Germany. The order could take effect and remain in place unless overturned on appeal, or unless the patent is invalidated by the German Federal Patent Court.\nTrial in the UK matter is scheduled for April 2024. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including that there are significant factual and legal issues to be\nresolved and that uncertainty exists as to the scope of an injunction, if any, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might\narise from these lawsuits.\nBusiness Interruption Insurance Proceeds\nWe received $484 million of insurance proceeds, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2022, to compensate for business interruption and property damage from a temporary electrical\nbreakdown that occurred at one of our facilities in 2020.

Around the globe, companies are building their networks, systems, and solutions on\nopen standards-based platforms. Intel has helped set the stage for this movement, with our historic contributions in developing standards such as CXL, Thunderbolt\u2122, and PCI\nExpress* (PCIe*). We also contributed to the design, build, and validation of open-source products in the industry such as Linux*, Android*, and others. The world's developers\nconstantly innovate and expand the capabilities of these open platforms while increasing their stability, reliability, and security. In addition, microservices have enabled the\ndevelopment of flexible, loosely coupled services that are connected via application programming interfaces to create end-to-end processes. We use industry collaboration, co-\nengineering, and open-source contributions to accelerate software innovation.

    "context_text": "Market and Business Overview\nMarket Trends and Strategy\nWhile the automotive industry has moderately recovered from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and from acute supply chain shortages, with approximately 6% growth in\nglobal vehicle production year over year, production in 2022 was still roughly 8% below 2019 levels. We expect ADAS volumes to continue to grow faster than overall global\nvehicle production in the coming years and anticipate long-term ADAS growth from continued increases in the percentage of vehicles that are equipped with basic ADAS features\nfrom the factory. In addition to potential volume growth, our portfolio of advanced solutions has the potential to drive higher average system price over time.\nBeyond ADAS solutions, we believe that the availability of AVs will cause a significant transformation in mobility, including vehicle ownership and utilization. We expect that AV\ntechnology will eventually be accessed by consumers through shared-vehicle MaaS networks and in consumer-owned and operated AVs. We are pursuing this market trend by\nusing our eyes-on/hands-off Mobileye SuperVision* solution as a baseline to scale to our eyes-off/hands-off Chauffeur* consumer AV product in a variety of operational design\ndomains. As it relates to AMaaS, we intend to primarily go to market by supplying Mobileye Drive* self-driving system to transportation network companies, public transit\noperators, and suppliers of AV-ready vehicle platforms. In some cases, we expect t",

As explained in \"Note 2: Accounting Policies\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements, the\nCompany computes inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis, and applies judgment in determining saleability\nof products and the valuation of inventories. The Company assesses inventory at each reporting date in order\nto assert that it is recorded at net realizable value, giving consideration to, among other factors: whether the\nproducts have achieved the substantive engineering milestones to qualify for sale to customers; the\ndetermination of normal capacity levels in its manufacturing process to determine which manufacturing\noverhead costs can be included in the valuation of inventory; whether the product is valued at the lower of\ncost or net realizable value; and the estimation of excess and obsolete inventory or that which is not of\nsaleable quality.\nAuditing management's assessment of net realizable value for inventory was challenging because the\ndetermination of lower of cost or net realizable value and excess and obsolete inventory reserves is\njudgmental and considers a number of factors that are affected by market and economic conditions, such as\ncustomer forecasts, dynamic pricing environments, and industry supply and demand.

Fiscal year 2022 was a 53-week fiscal year. Fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were 52-week fiscal\nyears. Fiscal 2023 is a 52-week fiscal year. Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Intel and our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, which\ninclude entities consolidated under the variable interest model. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts\nto conform to current period presentation.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we reclassified the presentation of cash paid and received under our credit support annex agreements with derivative counterparties within our\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These reclassifications better reflect the economic intent of the credit support annex agreements, and result in changes to amounts\npreviously reported for net cash provided by (used for) operating, investing, and financing activities.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we reclassified the presentation of certain marketable debt investments within our Consolidated Balance Sheets, combining all marketable debt\ninvestments with original contractual maturities of three months or more into short-term investments as they represent the investment of cash available for current operations.\nThese reclassifications simplify our Consolidated ",

Our process and product development life cycle corresponds with substantive engineering milestones. These engineering\nmilestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities and associated costs change in nature from R&D to cost of sales, and when cost of\nsales can be capitalized as inventory.\nFor a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications. This\nmilestone is known as PRQ. We have identified PRQ as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory. A single PRQ\nhas previously valued inventory up to $870 million in the quarter the PRQ milestone was achieved. Prior to PRQ, costs that do not meet the criteria for R&D are included in cost\nof sales in the period incurred.\nThe valuation of inventory includes determining which fixed production overhead costs can be included in inventory based on the normal capacity of our manufacturing and\nassembly and test facilities. We apply our historical loadings compared to our total available capacity in a statistical model to determine our normal capacity level. If the factory\nloadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our fixed production overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; instead, it wou",

These reviews can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our\nbusiness strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. Periodically, we also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether\nevents or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization. We may adjust the period over which these assets are amortized to reflect the\nperiod in which they contribute to our cash flows.\nGoodwill\nOur reporting units are the same as our operating segments. We evaluate our reporting units annually or when triggered, such as upon reorganization of our operating segments.\nWe perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment\nexist. The reporting unit's carrying value used in an impairment assessment represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and\nliabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt.

    "context_text": "Table of Contents\nFair Value\nWhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use\nwhen pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the\nmeasurement alternative, equity method investments, and grants receivable. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio\nbased on the underlying instrument type.\nThe three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are:\n\u25aa\nLevel 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.\n\u25aa\nLevel 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations.\nAll significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for\nsubstantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We use LIBOR- and SOFR-based yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and\ncredit ratings as significant inputs in our valuations.

Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and preferences of\nthe securities. Recording upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of our equity securities as a result of observable price changes requires quantitative\nassessments of the fair value of our securities using various valuation methodologies and involves the use of estimates.\nNon-marketable equity securities and equity method investments (collectively referred to as non-marketable equity investments) are also subject to periodic impairment reviews.\nOur quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investee's fair value. Qualitative factors considered\ninclude the investee's financial condition and business outlook, industry and sector performance, market for technology, operational and financing cash flow activities, and other\nrelevant events and factors affecting the investee.

We generally place investments with high-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, we limit the amount of\ncredit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty's relative credit standing. As required per our investment policy, substantially all of our\ninvestments in debt instruments are in investment-grade instruments. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments.\nWe enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. Due to master\nnetting arrangements, the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty's obligations\nexceed our obligations with that counterparty. As of December\u00a031, 2022, our total credit exposure to any single counterparty, excluding money market funds invested in US\ntreasury and US agency securities and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by treasury and agency securities, did not exceed $2.9 billion.

For the assets that we\nhave the discretion to set investment guidelines, the assets are invested in developed country equity investments and fixed-income investments, either through index funds or\ndirect investment. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, asset classes, or individual securities to reduce market\nrisk and to help enable sufficient pension assets to be available to pay benefits as they come due. The equity investments in the non-US plan assets are invested in a diversified\nmix of equities of developed countries, including the US, and emerging markets throughout the world. We have control over the investment strategy related to the majority of the\nassets measured at net asset value, which are invested in hedge funds, bond index funds and equity index funds.

In September 2017, the Court of Justice sent the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition.\nIn January 2022, the General Court annulled the EC\u2019s 2009 findings against us regarding rebates, as well as the fine imposed on Intel, which was returned to us in February\n2022. In April 2022, the EC appealed the General Court\u2019s decision to the Court of Justice. A hearing date on the appeal has not been scheduled. The General Court\u2019s January\n2022 decision did not annul the EC\u2019s 2009 finding that Intel made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products, and in January 2023 the EC reopened its administrative\nprocedure to determine a fine against Intel based on that alleged conduct. Given the procedural posture and the nature of this proceeding, we are unable to make a reasonable\nestimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from this matter.\nIn a related matter, we filed applications with the General Court in April 2022 seeking an order requiring the EC to pay Intel approximately \u20ac593 million in default interest.\nLitigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities\nIn June 2017, a Google research team notified Intel and other companies\u202fthat it had identified security vulnerabilities,",

In December 2022, VLSI stipulated to dismiss with prejudice its claims, for which Intel paid nothing. The court\ndismissed the case in January 2023.\nIn April 2019, VLSI filed three infringement suits against Intel in the Western District of Texas (WDTX) accusing various Intel processors of infringement of eight additional patents\nit had acquired from NXP. The first Texas case went to trial in February 2021, and the jury awarded VLSI $1.5 billion for literal infringement of one patent and $675 million for\ninfringement of another patent under the doctrine of equivalents.

This enables each individual organization to develop the minimum \namount of documentation needed in order to demonstrate the effective planning, operation and control \nof its processes and the implementation and continual improvement of the effectiveness of its QMS.  \n \nIt is stressed that ISO 9001 requires (and always has required) a \u201cDocumented quality management \nsystem\u201d, and not a \u201csystem of documents\u201d. \n \n \n \n2  What is a \u201cdocument\u201d? - Definitions and reference",

This policy includes, for the avoidance of doubt any personally \nowned devices that are used in connection with University activities (together, IT \nSystems).  This policy applies to all users and administrators of IT Systems, inclusive of \nUniversity staff, students, affiliates, and third-party providers.  \n \n1. Introduction \n1.1. The threats we face \nThe University is facing increasing security threats from a wide range of sources.  \nSystems and networks may be the target of a variety of attacks, including computer-\nbased fraud, data theft, surveillance or vandalism.  Such threats to IT security are \ngenerally expected to become more widespread, more ambitious and increasingly \nsophisticated. \n \nBecause of increasing dependence on IT systems and services, the University is \nbecoming more vulnerable to security threats.  The growth of networking, cloud \nservices and mobile devices presents new opportunities for unauthorised access to \ncompu",
